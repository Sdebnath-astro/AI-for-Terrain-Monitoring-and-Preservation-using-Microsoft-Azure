# AI-for-Terrain-Monitoring-and-Preservation-using-Microsoft-Azure
The core idea of the project is to develope programmes based on physics-enabled AI models to help organizations understand climate-related risk at the hyperlocal level. The analysis of various topographic data of different regions may be accessed through the cloud-baesd platform of Azure. By combining historical fire data with existing physical simulations and real-time satellite observations, the main focus will be baesd on building sophisticated fire risk models that will be made available via APIs and graphical interfaces for mitigating the effects of wildfires.
